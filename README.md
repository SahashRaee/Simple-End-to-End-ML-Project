## Features
- Predicts placement status based on CGPA.
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Logistic regression model for classification.
- Integration with a web application for user input.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask (for web integration)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average of the students.
- **Name**: Names of the students (not used in prediction).
- **Placement Status**: Indicates whether the student was placed (Yes/No).
